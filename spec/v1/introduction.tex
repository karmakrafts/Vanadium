Once one decides to create a new programming language, there is always
this one question that gets asked instantly: why?\\
And that is a very good question indeed, the market is over-saturated
with newcomer languages like Kotlin, Zig, Julia, Rust, Carbon and more.\\

\quotebox{Alexander R. Hinze}{
    The main reason why i initially created Ferrous is quite simple:\\
    i wanted a programming language with the metaprogramming capabilities
    of a language like C++ or Rust, which is able to compile to JVM bytecode.
}

\noindent
Which makes sense if you look at it.\\
Kotlin comes very close to what I wanted in a language, but it's still not
quite there.\\
It has the right ideas implemented for its type system, however a big puzzle
piece is still missing: proper zero-cost-abstraction.\\
\\
At some point down the line however, the JVM as a single target wasn't enough
anymore, and we decided to turn Ferrous into a multi-target language.\\
This decision was made very early on during the PoC phase of project to ensure the
language being designed for that exact purpose from the ground up.\\
